Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
a3,com.nonononoki.alovoa,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.nonononoki.alovoa.config; com.nonononoki.alovoa.model
a3,com.nonononoki.alovoa,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ToolsTest; Tools; DateUtils; DistanceUtils; AuthParams]; [AlovoaApplication]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
a3,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.62.
